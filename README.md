   - Ensure you have a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
   - No additional dependencies are required for a static web app.

## Usage

1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Enter a number in the input field.
3. Select the source numerical system (e.g., decimal) and the target system (e.g., binary).
4. View the converted result instantly.
5. Use the reset button to clear inputs and start a new conversion.

Example:

- Input: `42` (Decimal)
